        <h3>Shortbread cookie topper</h3>

            <li>2 Girl Scout Samoas cookies</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour + more for surface</li>
            <li>1 stick cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 325˚F.</li>
            <li>Place cookies and 1/2 cup flour in a food processor and pulverize until there are no large cookie chunks left. Set aside in a small bowl. Alternatively, chop the cookies using a sharp kitchen knife.</li>
            <li>Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold in the cookie-and-flour mixture until all of the flour is incorporated. Be careful not to mix the cookie dough too much!</li>
            <li>Place the dough in plastic wrap or a resealable plastic bag; chill for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>When dough is firm enough to roll out, dust work surface with flour.</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, roll dough out to ¼-inch thick and cut out cookies using desired cookie cutter. The dough can be rerolled up to 2 times.</li>
            <li>Place the cookie cutouts on a sheet pan with parchment and bake until golden brown, 5-6 minutes.</li>
